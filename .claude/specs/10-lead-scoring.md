# Spec: Lead Scoring

## Overview
This step adds the "scoring" stage of the DASHR AI roadmap (capture → extraction → enrichment → **scoring** → review/export). Once a card has been parsed (step 05) and, optionally, its company enriched with firmographics/signals (step 07), a seller needs a single product-fit number to triage which leads are worth following up on first. This feature computes an explainable, rules-based `lead_score` (0–100) and a `score_breakdown` for each `VisitingCard`, using the seller's own target-customer calibration (`SellerProfile`, step 06) against the prospect's designation seniority, company size, industry/product fit, and buying-intent signals already captured on the card and its linked `Company`/`CompanySignals`. The dashboard's "Leads" table — currently rendering hardcoded mock scores — is wired to this real score so sellers can sort/filter on actual fit instead of a placeholder.

Scoring is deliberately **not** a new `Lead` entity. `VisitingCard` already carries unused `lead_score` (Numeric), `score_breakdown` (JSONB), and `scored_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) columns from the original schema (`01-database-setup.md`) — this step is the first to populate them. No new table, and no `org_id` column is added anywhere in this step.

**Amended by `20-field-correction` (Phase 2, done):** the one-shot rule below now has exactly one exception — once a card has been scored, correcting any of that card's fields (see `20-field-correction`) unlocks one free rescore. Every "one-shot"/"no re-score" statement in this file describes the *default* state (no correction since the last score); see that spec's Phase 2 section for the full free-rescore mechanics (`rescore_available`, `_has_correction_since_score`, never billed).

## Depends on
- **04 — Visiting card bulk upload**: cards must exist (`visiting_cards`, `upload_batch_id`).
- **05 — Parsing visiting card**: scoring requires a card to have reached `status == "extracted"`, and reuses `designation.classify()` output already stored on `VisitingCard.designation_level`.
- **06 — Company profile backend**: scoring reads `SellerProfile` (`industry`, `product_lines`, `target_customer_description`) as the fit-calibration input.
- **07 — Data enrichment**: scoring reads `CompanySignals` (`linkedin_employee_count`, `hiring_signal`, `gem_tender_count`, `import_export_activity`, `marketplace_verified_badge`, `udyam_category`, `product_lines_summary`) and `Company` (`name`, `enrichment_status`). Enrichment is **not required** before scoring — a card can be scored right after extraction with company-derived criteria simply scoring 0/low until enrichment completes, and re-scored later to pick up enrichment data.

Steps 08 (delete card) and 09 (bulk select/parse/enrich) are unrelated and not required.

## API endpoints (apps/api)

- `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` — score a single card now — org-authenticated (owner or org-admin visibility via `scope_to_visible_users`) — no request body; returns `CardOut` (200, now carrying `rescore_available: bool` per `20-field-correction` Phase 2). Raises `404` if the card isn't visible to the current user, `409` (`CardNotEligibleForScoringError`) if `card.status != "extracted"`, `409` (`CardAlreadyScoredError`) if `card.lead_score` is already set **and no field was corrected since** (see amendment above). Mirrors the existing `POST /cards/{card_id}/enrich-company` single-action CTA pattern exactly — an explicit "Score Card" action, never auto-triggered after parsing or enrichment. **Scoring is one-shot per card by default**: once a card has been scored, it cannot be re-scored, even if it's later enriched with better company data — there is no "Re-score Card" affordance unless the seller first corrects a field. Sellers should enrich a company (step 07) before scoring a card, not after, to get the best score on the one attempt.

- `POST /cards/score` — bulk score a seller-selected set of cards — org-authenticated — request `CardScoreRequest {card_ids: list[UUID], min_length=1}`, response `CardScoreResponse {enqueued_count: int, skipped_count: int}` (200). Cards that aren't visible to the current user, aren't `status == "extracted"`, or are already scored (`lead_score is not None`) are silently skipped and counted, not raised — mirrors `POST /cards/enrich-companies`'s best-effort batch semantics exactly. **Deliberately unchanged by `20-field-correction` Phase 2**: `enqueue_scoring` still skips every already-scored card unconditionally, even one with a correction since its last score — free rescoring is a single-card, drawer-only affordance (correcting a field is itself a drawer-only action), not a bulk one; a documented scope boundary, not an oversight.

Both endpoints enqueue a Celery task per card rather than compute synchronously in the handler, per CLAUDE.md's "bulk/long-running work is a Celery task, not inline in a request handler" and to keep the single- and bulk-card code paths identical (one task, `.delay()`'d once or many times) — see "Background jobs" below.

## Frontend surface (apps/web)

- **Modified: `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`** ("Leads" page) — replace the hardcoded `LEADS` mock array with a real `listCards()` fetch. Extend the existing table (Name / Company / Designation / Score) to render real `lead_score`/`scored_at` through the page's existing `ScoreBadge` component (already buckets `>= 80` HIGH / `>= 60` MED / else LOW — reused as-is, not redesigned). Cards with `lead_score == null` show an "Unscored" badge state instead of a numeric bucket. Stats tiles ("Total Leads", "High Fit", "Low Fit") derive from real data instead of the mock array. **This page has no scoring CTA at all** — no bulk "Score Selected" button and no per-row scoring affordance. The Leads page is a pure triage/view surface; scoring is only ever initiated from the Upload page, where cards are also parsed and enriched. (The bulk "Export CSV" action, unrelated to scoring, is unaffected.)

- **Modified: `apps/web/app/upload/page.tsx`** — the bulk "Score" button and the per-row "Score card" icon (next to the delete icon) are the only ways to trigger scoring. Both eligibility filters require `status === "extracted"` **and** `lead_score == null` — once a card is scored, its row icon disappears permanently (no re-score affordance) and it drops out of the bulk button's eligible count. Clicking the row icon swaps it for a spinner (`Loader2`, `animate-spin`) that stays visible until the card's `scored_at` actually changes (polling `listCards()`, not just until the enqueue POST resolves) — this was already built for the per-row spinner and is unchanged. Clicking the bulk "Score" button additionally renders a **progress bar** (`done/total` of the cards in that bulk batch) next to the button, tracking the same per-card `scored_at`-change signal as the row spinners, until every card in the batch has finished (or the row leaves tracking, e.g. deleted mid-score). **Unchanged by `20-field-correction` Phase 2** — see that bulk-scope note under `POST /cards/score` above; the row icon still stays gone once scored, even after a correction. A seller who wants the free rescore uses the card detail drawer.

- **Modified: `apps/web/components/card-detail-drawer.tsx`** — add a score section below the existing company enrichment badge row (employee count, revenue band, GSTIN✓, Udyam✓, hiring signal, Google rating), reusing that row's exact badge style. Shows `lead_score`/`scored_at` when present, a breakdown of the five `score_breakdown` components, and a "Score Card" button calling `scoreCard(cardId)` (disabled unless `status === "extracted"`, matching the backend eligibility rule). **Once `lead_score` is non-null, the button is replaced by a locked-state message** (e.g. "This card has already been scored.") — there was originally no "Re-score Card" variant. **Amended by `20-field-correction` Phase 2**: the locked-state message is now conditional on `rescore_available` — `false` keeps the message (reworded to point at the fix: "…correct a field to unlock a free rescore"), `true` shows a "Rescore Card" button instead, reusing the same `scoreCard(cardId)` call and `handleScoreCard`'s existing poll-until-`scored_at`-changes logic unchanged.

- **Modified: `apps/web/lib/api.ts`** — add `lead_score: number | null`, `score_breakdown: Record<string, number | string> | null`, `scored_at: string | null` to the `CardOut` and `CardDetailOut` TS types (hand-aligned to the Pydantic schema, never assumed). Add `scoreCard(cardId: string): Promise<CardOut>` and `scoreCards(cardIds: string[]): Promise<{enqueued_count: number; skipped_count: number}>` functions, mirroring `enrichCompany`/`enrichCompanies`.

## Database changes
No database changes. `visiting_cards.lead_score` (Numeric), `visiting_cards.score_breakdown` (JSONB), and `visiting_cards.scored_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) already exist from migration `0001_initial_schema.py` and are already declared on the `VisitingCard` model — this step is the first to write to them. No new table, no new column, no `org_id` addition (scoring reads `Company`/`CompanySignals`, which remain org-agnostic shared cache tables by existing design from step 07; tenant scoping is enforced only on the `visiting_cards` side via the existing `scope_to_visible_users` helper).

`score_breakdown` JSONB shape written by this step (versioned, per the original draft in `01-database-setup.md`):
```json
{
  "des/
}
```
Note: the original draft in `01-database-setup.md` named the fourth field `engagement_score`; this spec renames it `momentum_signal_score` for clarity (it scores company growth/momentum signals, not card-level engagement) — JSONB has no schema to migrate, so this is a naming decision, not a breaking change.

## Background jobs
- **New task: `app.workers.scoring_processing.score_card_task(self, card_id: str)`** — added to `celery_app.py`'s `include` list. Loads the `VisitingCard` plus its linked `Company`/`CompanySignals` (if any) and the scoring user's `SellerProfile`, calls `scoring.calculate_score(...)`, and writes `lead_score`, `score_breakdown`, `scored_at` onto the card. Follows the exact conventions already established by `enrich_company_task`/`process_card`: `bind=True`, `max_retries=3`, manual `self.retry(countdown=2**self.request.retries)`, `db = SessionLocal(); try/finally: db.close()`. Unlike enrichment, there is no in-flight status to guard against (`card.status` does not change during scoring — no external I/O, so no "scoring" intermediate state is needed); the retry-safety guard instead re-checks `card.status == "extracted"` on every attempt (fresh delivery or retry) and skips as stale if the card's status changed underneath it (e.g. deleted, merged) mid-retry.
- **Trigger**: enqueued only from `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` (single) and `POST /cards/score` (bulk) — never auto-chained after `process_card` or `enrich_company_task` complete, consistent with every existing pipeline stage being a distinct, seller-initiated action.

## Files to change
- `apps/api/app/workers/celery_app.py` — add `app.workers.scoring_processing` to `include`
- `apps/api/app/routers/cards.py` — add `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` and `POST /cards/score` endpoints
- `apps/api/app/schemas/cards.py` — add `lead_score`, `score_breakdown`, `scored_at` to `CardOut` and `CardDetailOut`; add `CardScoreRequest`/`CardScoreResponse`
- `apps/api/app/services/card_service.py` — add `score_card_now()` and `enqueue_scoring()` (mirroring `enrich_company_now()`/`enqueue_enrichment()`); include `lead_score`/`score_breakdown`/`scored_at` in `to_card_out()` and `get_card_detail()`
- `apps/api/app/services/exceptions.py` — add `CardNotEligibleForScoringError` and `CardAlreadyScoredError`
- `apps/web/lib/api.ts` — extend `CardOut`/`CardDetailOut` types; add `scoreCard`/`scoreCards`
- `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — replace mock `LEADS` with real `listCards()`; wire `ScoreBadge` to real scores; add "Score Selected" bulk action
- `apps/web/components/card-detail-drawer.tsx` — add score section + "Score Card" CTA

## Files to create
- `apps/api/app/services/scoring.py` — `calculate_score(card, company, signals, seller_profile) -> dict` returning the `score_breakdown` shape above; all weights, bands, and keyword lists defined as module-level constants (mirrors `enrichment_service.py`'s `_HIRING_SIGNAL_EXPANDING_THRESHOLD` / `_PAID_UP_CAPITAL_BAND_THRESHOLDS` pattern), never inline in the router or worker. Reuses `designation.classify()` for seniority rather than reimplementing it. v1 criteria (max 100):
  - `designation_score` (max 30): from `VisitingCard.designation_level` — c_level=30, director=22, manager=14, individual_contributor=6, none=0
  - `company_size_score` (max 25): from `CompanySignals.linkedin_employee_count` banded (500+=25, 100–499=18, 20–99=10, 1–19=4, none=0); falls back to `CompanySignals.udyam_category` (medium=15, small=8) when employee count is unavailable
  - `industry_fit_score` (max 25): keyword-overlap match between `SellerProfile.industry`/`product_lines` and `Company.name` + `CompanySignals.product_lines_summary` + `VisitingCard.products_offered`, bucketed by overlap strength (0/8/15/25). Documented limitation: no formal NAICS/SIC classification exists yet anywhere in the codebase (confirmed absent from both `Company` and `CompanySignals`), so this is a text-similarity proxy, not a coded industry match — a future step can replace this criterion's implementation without changing its weight or the `score_breakdown` shape.
  - `momentum_signal_score` (max 10): `CompanySignals.hiring_signal == "expanding"` (+4), `gem_tender_count > 0` (+2), `import_export_activity` (+2), `marketplace_verified_badge` (+2)
  - `remark_signal_score` (max 10): keyword scan of `VisitingCard.special_remark` against a static positive-intent keyword list (e.g. "follow up", "urgent", "interested", "budget") — match=10, non-empty remark with no match=3, empty/null=0
- `apps/api/app/workers/scoring_processing.py` — `score_card` Celery task, per "Background jobs" above

## New dependencies
No new dependencies.

## Rules for implementation
- Every query touching `visiting_cards` filters through the existing `scope_to_visible_users` helper against `VisitingCard.user_id` — do not add a new `org_id` column to `visiting_cards`, `companies`, or `company_signals`; follow the org-scoping deviation already established in step 01 (`users.org_id`/`role`, not a literal column on every table)
- No raw SQL string interpolation — SQLAlchemy query builder or bound params only
- All scoring weights, bands, and keyword lists live in `scoring.py` as module-level data, never as inline branches in `routers/cards.py` or `workers/scoring_processing.py`
- Scoring computation itself (`calculate_score`) is a pure function — no DB writes, no Celery/session imports inside `scoring.py`; only the Celery task and service layer touch the database
- Bulk scoring is always a Celery task per card, never synchronous in the request handler, even though the computation itself is cheap — this keeps the single-card and bulk-card code paths identical and leaves room for slower scoring signals (e.g. an LLM-based qualitative fit pass) to be added later without changing the API contract
- `score_card` never changes `VisitingCard.status` — `scored_at` being non-null is the only signal that a card has been scored, exactly as `Company.enrichment_status` (not `VisitingCard.status`) is the signal for enrichment completion
- Scoring is never auto-triggered after parsing or enrichment completes — it is always a seller-initiated action via the `/score` endpoints
- **Scoring is one-shot per card, enforced server-side, not just hidden in the UI.** `score_card_now` and `enqueue_scoring` both reject/skip a card whose `lead_score` is already set (`CardAlreadyScoredError`, 409, for the single-card endpoint; silently skipped+counted for bulk) — a client cannot bypass the "no re-score" rule by calling the API directly even though the UI never exposes a re-score control
- The dashboard/"Leads" page (`apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) never initiates scoring — no bulk or per-row scoring CTA exists there. All scoring is initiated from the Upload page (bulk button + per-row icon) or the card detail drawer's one-shot "Score Card" button
- API contracts are the Pydantic models (`CardScoreRequest`/`CardScoreResponse`, extended `CardOut`/`CardDetailOut`) — the TS types in `apps/web/lib/api.ts` are hand-aligned to match, never assumed

## Definition of done
- [ ] `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` on an `extracted` card returns 200 with a populated `lead_score` (0–100), `score_breakdown` (all 5 components + `total` + `version: "v1"`), and `scored_at`, and the same values persist on `GET /cards/{card_id}`
- [ ] `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` on a card with `status != "extracted"` (e.g. `"new"` or `"processing"`) returns 409
- [ ] `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` on a card not visible to the current user (wrong owner, different org) returns 404
- [ ] `POST /cards/score` with a mix of eligible, ineligible, and already-scored card IDs returns correct `enqueued_count`/`skipped_count`, and only eligible cards get a `scoring_processing.score_card_task` task enqueued (verify via Celery task call assertions in tests)
- [ ] `POST /cards/{card_id}/score` on an already-scored card (`lead_score` non-null, `status == "extracted"`) with no correction since its last score returns 409 (`CardAlreadyScoredError`) and never enqueues a task; `lead_score`/`score_breakdown`/`scored_at` are unchanged. (See `20-field-correction` Phase 2 for the free-rescore exception once a field has been corrected since.)
- [ ] `POST /cards/score` (bulk) silently skips an already-scored card in the selection, counting it in `skipped_count`, without enqueueing a task for it
- [ ] A card scored with no linked company (`company_id is None`) still scores successfully, with `company_size_score`, `industry_fit_score`, and `momentum_signal_score` all `0`
- [ ] `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` renders real scores from `listCards()` (no `LEADS` mock array remaining), `ScoreBadge` buckets match real `lead_score` values, and the page has **no** scoring CTA (bulk or per-row)
- [ ] `apps/web/app/upload/page.tsx`'s per-row "Score card" icon shows a spinner while scoring and disappears permanently once the card is scored (no re-score icon); the bulk "Score" button shows a live `done/total` progress bar while a bulk batch is in flight
- [ ] `apps/web/components/card-detail-drawer.tsx` shows the score breakdown and a working one-shot "Score Card" button (disabled unless `status === "extracted"`) that's replaced by a locked-state message once the card has been scored, or by a free "Rescore Card" button once a field has been corrected since (`20-field-correction` Phase 2)
- [ ] `docker-compose` Celery worker logs show `scoring_processing.score_card_task` tasks executing (task registered in `celery_app.py`'s `include`)
- [ ] No query against `visiting_cards` in the new code paths omits the `scope_to_visible_users` scoping
